# Wendigo

Wendigo is an extensible malware/botnet framework using GitHub for C2. It downloads a configuation file from GitHub and then reads the modules to run in separate threads. If a module isn't present in memory it downloads it from GitHub. The framework is lightweight and unassuming, with all potentially suspicious code only running in memory after being securely downloaded.

Files include:
  - wendigo.py: the main script
  - blank.py: a version of wendigo.py with all names switched to uids, used in generation of obfuscated script
  - conf.ig: a json file used as a single options file for all other scripts
  - g_mod.py: takes config and module files and builds them into encrypted zip archives
  - p_mod.py: base64 encodes archives generated by g_mod.py and pushes them to the specified GitHub paths
  - g_pk.py: generates RSA private/public key pairs
  - decrypt.py: decrypts encrypted data files produced by wendigo

Usage:
  - Create a GitHub repo with required file paths and fill a config file with the required data
  - Use the build script to generate a clean version of wendigo
  - Use helper scripts to generate keys and upload module and config files
